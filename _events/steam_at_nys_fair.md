In 2017, the [Great New York State Fair added in a STEAM Exhibit](https://nysfair.ny.gov/new-steam-exhibit-great-new-york-state-fair-seeks-applications-potential-participating-organizations/) as part of the Science and Industry Building within the fair grounds. I was lucky enough to serve on the inaugural committee. Within the committee, I recruited STEAM organizations and makers across the state to exhibit for the duration of the fair. I've continued working with the committee through 2019.
