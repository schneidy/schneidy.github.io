The goal of the New York State Maker Summit was to bring makers, makerspaces, maker events, educators, politicians, manufacturers, industry leaders, museums, libraries, and anyone who is passionate about the Maker Movement together to learn about each other, talk about partnerships & the problems that we all run into, and discuss how to grow the movement within the state.
