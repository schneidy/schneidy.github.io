<p>I'm a organizer, developer, maker and baker. Currently living in Rochester, NY.</p>


<p>In the past, I've been one of the organizers for BarCamp Rochester, mentor of FIRST Robotics teams, and active volunteer at FIRST events (mostly in the Finger Lakes areas).</p>


<p>I love to dabble in open government projects, data for good, baking experiments, animation and graphic novels.</p>


<p>Currently, I'm working on organizing the second Rochester Mini Maker Faire, planning maker events around the city, and trying to promote STEAM whenever I can.</p>


<p>I graduated from the Rochester Institute of Technology in New York, and was an alumni member of Computer Science House there.</p>
