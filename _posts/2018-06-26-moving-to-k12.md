Starting Monday, I will officially be working for the RIT K-12 University Center as an Outreach Specialist! The position is really broad as I'll be doing a bit of everything from helping out with camps, running hands-on activities with some of the special programs that RIT runs (GEAR UP & STEP), along with designing some of my own programs and events. There will definitely be a maker flavor to most of the activities that I'll end up running (already have a few ideas brewing).

There is a chance that this position will evolve into something much bigger sooner than later, but it's not official and I'll hopefully be able to announce what I'm working on by the end of the summer.
