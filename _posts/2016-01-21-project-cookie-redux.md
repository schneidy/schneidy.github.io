So it’s over a year since I last posted. Figured I would pick up where I last left off.

Project cookie was pretty successful. Within one month, I was able to deliver cookies to friends at New Work City, TurboVote, Frederator’s NYC office (they even tweeted about it!), and a bunch of friends living around the city.

While I may not have been able to get to make as many cookies as I had originally hoped, it made a good ending to my time living in NYC.
