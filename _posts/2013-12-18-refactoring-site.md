title: Updating Site
---

I've finally started to redo my entire website in Jekyll. This mostly comes from wanting an easier way to blog and document several non coding projects.

Over the next month or so, I should be transferring my projects over to Heroku and getting them off my old hosting service, along with adding styles to the site.

Looking forward to writing again.
