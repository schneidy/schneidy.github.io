# The production_url is only used when full-domain names are needed
# such as sitemap.txt 
# Most places will/should use BASE_PATH to make the urls
#
# If you have set a CNAME (pages.github.com) set your custom domain here.
# Else if you are pushing to username.github.io, replace with your username.
# Finally if you are pushing to a GitHub project page, include the project name at the end.

# Social sharing protocols

# All Jekyll-Bootstrap specific configurations are namespaced into this hash
#
# JB :
#   version : 0.3.0

#   # All links will be namespaced by BASE_PATH if defined.
#   # Links in your website should always be prefixed with {{BASE_PATH}}
#   # however this value will be dynamically changed depending on your deployment situation.
#   #
#   # CNAME (http://yourcustomdomain.com)
#   #   DO NOT SET BASE_PATH 
#   #   (urls will be prefixed with "/" and work relatively)
#   #
#   # GitHub Pages (http://username.github.io)
#   #   DO NOT SET BASE_PATH 
#   #   (urls will be prefixed with "/" and work relatively)
#   #
#   # GitHub Project Pages (http://username.github.io/project-name)
#   #
#   #   A GitHub Project site exists in the `gh-pages` branch of one of your repositories.
#   #  REQUIRED! Set BASE_PATH to: http://username.github.io/project-name
#   #
#   # CAUTION:
#   #   - When in Localhost, your site will run from root "/" regardless of BASE_PATH
#   #   - Only the following values are falsy: ["", null, false]
#   #   - When setting BASE_PATH it must be a valid url.
#   #     This means always setting the protocol (http|https) or prefixing with "/"
#   BASE_PATH : false

#   # By default, the asset_path is automatically defined relative to BASE_PATH plus the enabled theme.
#   # ex: [BASE_PATH]/assets/themes/[THEME-NAME]
#   #
#   # Override this by defining an absolute path to assets here.
#   # ex: 
#   #   http://s3.amazonaws.com/yoursite/themes/watermelon
#   #   /assets
#   #
#   ASSET_PATH : false

#   # These paths are to the main pages Jekyll-Bootstrap ships with.
#   # Some JB helpers refer to these paths; change them here if needed.
#   #
#   archive_path: /archive.html
#   categories_path : /categories.html
#   tags_path : /tags.html
#   atom_path : /atom.xml
#   rss_path : /rss.xml

#   # Settings for comments helper
#   # Set 'provider' to the comment provider you want to use.
#   # Set 'provider' to false to turn commenting off globally.

#   # Settings for analytics helper
#   # Set 'provider' to the analytics provider you want to use.

#   # Settings for sharing helper. 
#   # Sharing is for things like tweet, plusone, like, reddit buttons etc.
#   # Set 'provider' to the sharing provider you want to use.
#   # Set 'provider' to false to turn sharing off globally.
#   #
#   sharing :
#     provider : false
    
#   # Settings for all other include helpers can be defined by creating 
#   # a hash with key named for the given helper. ex:
#   #
#   #   pages_list :
#   #     provider : "custom"   
#   #
#   # Setting any helper's provider to 'custom' will bypass the helper code
#   # and include your custom code. Your custom file must be defined at:
#   #   ./_includes/custom/[HELPER]
#   # where [HELPER] is the name of the helper you are overriding.
